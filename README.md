### Hello!!

I am a hobbyist who programs mainly in C. I also know some other languages such as Java or PHP.

#### My best projects:
* [FATReader](https://github.com/Vitaspiros/FATReader), a program to read from drives formatted with the FAT filesystem
* [feta](https://github.com/Vitaspiros/feta), a typographic error detector for text written for the Modern Greek language
* [mandelbrotViewer](https://github.com/Vitaspiros/mandelbrotViewer), a program that can render the beautiful Mandelbrot fractal

Have a nice day!
